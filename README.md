# Iris-Flower-Classification-
A Machine learning model to predict the category of the flower on the basis of its physical features. This a model based on supervised learning where the model is first trained and then tested on a set of data. Then the accuracy of the model is calculated

I have used NumPy, Pandas and Sklearn as the main libraries. The code is written in the python language. The code in itself is explanatory which tells you why that piece of code is written over there and what purpose will it solve. You will also observe line by line execution of the code as it is juptyer notebook file.
